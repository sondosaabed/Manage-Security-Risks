    "## The relationship between frameworks and controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you learned how organizations use security frameworks and controls to protect against threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. This included discussions about the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) Risk Management Framework (RMF) and Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad. In this reading, you will further explore security frameworks and controls and how they are used together to help mitigate organizational risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frameworks and controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. Frameworks support organizations’ ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations. For example, the healthcare industry uses frameworks to comply with the United States’ Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires that medical professionals keep patient information safe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. Security controls are the measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy. For example, a control that can be used alongside frameworks to ensure a hospital remains compliant with HIPAA is requiring that patients use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access their medical records. Using a measure like MFA to validate someone’s identity is one way to help mitigate potential risks and threats to private data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific frameworks and controls\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different frameworks and controls that organizations can use to remain compliant with regulations and achieve their security goals. Frameworks covered in this reading are the Cyber Threat Framework (CTF) and the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001. Several common security controls, used alongside these types of frameworks, are also explained. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CTF was developed by the U.S. government to provide “a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.” By providing a common language to communicate information about threat activity, the CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently. This allows organizations to improve their response to the constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape and threat actors' many tactics and techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001\n",
    "\n",
    "An internationally recognized and used framework is ISO/IEC 27001. The ISO 27000 family of standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties. This framework outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organization’s ability to manage risks. Although the ISO/IEC 27001 framework does not require the use of specific controls, it does provide a collection of controls that organizations can use to improve their security posture. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Controls are used alongside frameworks to reduce the possibility and impact of a security threat, risk, or vulnerability. Controls can be physical, technical, and administrative and are typically used to prevent, detect, or correct security issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of physical controls:\n",
    "- Gates, fences, and locks\n",
    "- Security guards\n",
    "- Closed-circuit television (CCTV), surveillance cameras, and motion detectors\n",
    "- Access cards or badges to enter office spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of technical controls:\n",
    "- Firewalls\n",
    "- MFA\n",
    "- Antivirus software\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of administrative controls:\n",
    "- Separation of duties\n",
    "- Authorization\n",
    "- Asset classification\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about controls, particularly those used to protect health-related assets from a variety of threat types, review the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Physical Access Control presentation\n",
    " \n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Cybersecurity frameworks and controls are used together to establish an organization’s security posture. They also support an organization’s ability to meet security goals and comply with laws and regulations. Although these frameworks and controls are typically voluntary, organizations are strongly encouraged to implement and use them to help ensure the safety of critical assets."

    "## Use the CIA triad to protect organizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you were introduced to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad and how it helps organizations consider and mitigate risk. In this reading, you will learn how cybersecurity analysts use the CIA triad in the workplace. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The CIA triad for analysts\n",
    "\n",
    "The CIA triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. It is made up of three elements that cybersecurity analysts and organizations work toward upholding: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Maintaining an acceptable level of risk and ensuring systems and policies are designed with these elements in mind helps establish a successful security posture, which refers to an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidentiality\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidentiality is the idea that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. In an organization, confidentiality can be enhanced through the implementation of design principles, such as the principle of least privilege. The principle of least privilege limits users' access to only the information they need to complete work-related tasks. Limiting access is one way of maintaining the confidentiality and security of private data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrity is the idea that the data is verifiably correct, authentic, and reliable. Having protocols in place to verify the authenticity of data is essential. One way to verify data integrity is through cryptography, which is used to transform data so unauthorized parties cannot read or tamper with it (NIST, 2022). Another example of how an organization might implement integrity is by enabling encryption, which is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. Encryption can be used to prevent access and ensure data, such as messages on an organization's internal chat platform, cannot be tampered with.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Availability\n",
    "\n",
    "Availability is the idea that data is accessible to those who are authorized to use it. When a system adheres to both availability and confidentiality principles, data can be used when needed. In the workplace, this could mean that the organization allows remote employees to access its internal network to perform their jobs. It’s worth noting that access to data on the internal network is still limited, depending on what type of access employees need to do their jobs. If, for example, an employee works in the organization’s accounting department, they might need access to corporate accounts but not data related to ongoing development projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The CIA triad is essential for establishing an organization’s security posture. Knowing what it is and how it’s applied can help you better understand how security teams work to protect organizations and the people they serve. "
