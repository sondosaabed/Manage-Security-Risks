# Manage-Security-Risks
In this course, I developed a greater understanding of the eight Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) security domains, as well as specific security frameworks and controls. I have also been introduced to how to use security tools and audits to help protect assets and data. These are key concepts in the cybersecurity field, and understanding them helps keeping organizations, and the people they serve, safe from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
